Assignment 4: Security and Privacy

All aspects have been implemented "correctly" in that they have been written.
This does not mean that they have been well written though.

I collaborated with Noaf, Jay, Philip M., and Brian. (last names forgotten)

Approximately 3 hours were spent working on this assignment.

Notes: I did modify (Toffler, Mikayla)'s server side code to specify it as an
object with {passenger: (JSON DATA HERE)} or {vehicle: (JSON DATA HERE)}.
(Toffler, Mikayla) added me as a collaborator for her whole comp20 Github in
order to share her assignment 2 with me. I did not examine her security report,
but there is no way for me to prove that to you since I pulled the whole
repository.
