Assignment 4: Security and Privacy

All aspects have been implemented "correctly" in that they have been written.
This does not mean that they have been well written though.

I collaborated with Noaf, Jay, Philip M., and Brian. (last names forgotten)

Approximately 3 hours were spent working on this assignment.
